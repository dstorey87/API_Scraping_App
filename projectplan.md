# Project Plan for API Scraping Application

## Overview
This document outlines the steps necessary to complete the API Scraping Application. The project aims to scrape data from various APIs, process the results, and store them in a PostgreSQL database. The application leverages Google Trends data to guide content relevance. The plan is divided into phases to facilitate modular, incremental development and deployment.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality Implementation

### 1. API Integrations
- **Reddit Integration**: Extend the current API capabilities by integrating with the Reddit API. Focus on scraping trending topics from relevant subreddits.
  - Implement `fetch_reddit_data.py` to collect and structure Reddit data.
  - Store results in a new table named `reddit_articles`.

- **Guardian News API**: Add integration with the Guardian API to enhance the scope of news coverage.
  - Implement `fetch_guardian_api.py` and add functionality to save fetched articles to the existing database.

- **PyTrends Enhancement**: Expand on the current PyTrends integration.
  - Allow dynamic updating of trending topics at regular intervals.
  - Schedule PyTrends scraping tasks via a cron job or similar scheduler to ensure relevance.

### 2. Database Improvements
- **Database Design Review**: Refactor the database schema to accommodate new API sources.
  - Create tables for `reddit_articles`, `guardian_articles`, and other relevant data sources.
  - Add necessary relationships and indexes to improve query performance.

- **Centralized Connection Management**: Enhance the `get_db_connection` function to include retry logic and better connection pooling, optimizing performance and reducing downtime.

## Phase 2: Data Processing and Quality Control

### 1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
- **Data Cleaning Module**: Implement a module (`data_cleaning.py`) that standardizes, validates, and cleans incoming data before inserting it into the database.
  - Address data consistency by ensuring field formats match the database schema.
  - Use Llama 3.2 Vision for sentiment analysis and keyword extraction.

### 2. Error Handling Improvements
- **Unified Error Logging**: Implement centralized logging using Python's `logging` library.
  - Configure logs to store in a dedicated `logs/` directory for easy debugging.
  - Ensure all API integrations have robust error handling and write detailed log messages for any failures.

### 3. Monitoring and Alerts
- **Health Check**: Implement an automatic health check endpoint (`/health`) to verify all API and database connections are functional.
- **Error Alerts**: Set up email or Slack notifications for critical errors using services like SMTP or webhook integrations.

## Phase 3: Deployment Enhancements

### 1. Docker Optimization
- **Dockerfile and Docker Compose Improvements**: Optimize the Docker configuration to reduce image size and improve build caching.
  - Ensure all dependencies are installed using a multi-stage Dockerfile to keep the production image lean.
  - Create a `.env.sample` file to serve as a template for environment configuration.

- **Service Configuration**: Refine the `docker-compose.yml` to add restart policies, ensuring services automatically restart on failure.

### 2. Deployment Automation
- **CI/CD Setup**: Set up GitHub Actions to automate testing, linting, and building Docker images.
  - Include steps to run unit tests from `test_harness.py` and deploy to a test environment.

### 3. Scalability Considerations
- **Database Sharding**: Assess the need for database sharding or read replicas to manage increased data volume as more APIs are integrated.
- **Horizontal Scaling for Scraping**: Implement scaling mechanisms using Docker Swarm or Kubernetes to handle multiple scraping tasks concurrently without service interruption.

## Phase 4: User Interface Development

### 1. Web Dashboard
- **Basic Frontend with Flask**: Create a simple Flask web interface (`web_interface.py`) to display the collected data.
  - Users can view trending topics, news articles, and manage data sources.

- **Admin Controls**: Provide an admin panel to control scraping schedules, view logs, and restart scraping jobs when needed.

## Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
- **Documentation Updates**: Maintain up-to-date documentation for every new integration, stored in the `docs/` directory.
  - Update the `README.md` with setup instructions for each phase as features are added.

- **Tutorials and Guides**: Create beginner-friendly `.md` files for major modules (e.g., `pytrends_integration.md`, `reddit_integration.md`) to help understand the functionality and setup.

## Timeline and Milestones
- **Week 1**: Complete Reddit and Guardian API integrations.
- **Week 2**: Database improvements and data cleaning module.
- **Week 3**: Enhance error handling and add logging/monitoring features.
- **Week 4**: Optimize Docker and automate deployment.
- **Week 5**: Develop and deploy the web dashboard.

## Key Goals
- **Modular Development**: Ensure each feature is modular and easily extensible.
- **Beginner-Friendly Documentation**: Tailor all documentation for novice developers, providing comprehensive guides.
- **Focus on Scalability**: Implement features with an eye towards scaling to handle larger volumes of data.

## Next Steps
- Review current `main.py` and existing integrations for refactoring opportunities.
- Start with implementing the Reddit API integration.
- Update the `project_plan.md` weekly with completed milestones and new priorities.
