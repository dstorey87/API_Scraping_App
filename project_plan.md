# Project Plan: API Scraping Application

## Version: 1.1

### Objective
The goal of this project is to build a robust API scraping application to retrieve, process, and store data from multiple APIs, including Google Trends (via PyTrends). This modular application will support future expansion, integrating AI for analysis and automation.

---

### Key Decisions and Updates

#### 1. Development Environment
- **Tools**: Python 3.13, PyTrends, PostgreSQL.
- **Dockerized Workflow**: 
  - PostgreSQL database and supporting tools run within Docker containers.
  - **Directory Structure**:
    - Root: `C:\\API_Scraping_App`
    - Modules: Organized in subfolders (e.g., `/scraping/pytrends`).

#### 2. Database Setup
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
  - Hosted in Docker with persistent storage for durable operations.
  - Schema `main_db` created with a module-specific table structure under `api_data`.

#### 3. Module: PyTrends Integration
- **Base Repository**: GeneralMills/PyTrends
  - Cloned and customized for modular data scraping.
  - Installed and configured in `C:\\API_Scraping_App\\scraping\\pytrends`.
- **Current Functionality**:
  - Fetches trending data from Google related to technology and AI.
  - Outputs raw data to a CSV file for review and subsequent processing.
  - Plans in place to migrate this data into PostgreSQL after validation.

#### 4. Project Documentation
- **README.md**: General overview and setup instructions for new developers.
- **project_plan.md**: Tracks decisions, progress, and next steps.
- **Code Documentation**: Inline comments and links to libraries/tools used (e.g., PyTrends documentation).
- **Best Practices**:
  - Always reference the latest official repositories and updated modules.
  - Document all key dependencies and scripts for traceability.

---

### Next Steps
1. **Enhance PyTrends Script**:
   - Add error handling for rate limits (e.g., back-off mechanism).
   - Refine data structure and filtering to improve relevancy and quality.
2. **Database Integration**:
   - Develop a pipeline to move validated data from CSV into PostgreSQL.
   - Create and optimize database tables for trending topics.
3. **Expand API Scraping**:
   - Research and add modules for additional APIs (e.g., News APIs, SEO tools).
   - Implement modular structure for ease of integration and scaling.
4. **Automation**:
   - Schedule recurring scrapes with automated retries for failures.
   - Test Docker-based deployment and scale multiple scraping tasks.

---

### Current Challenges
- Ensuring seamless integration of PyTrends within the modular application.
- Managing Google Trends rate limits with efficient retries.
- Structuring raw data for both CSV output and database storage.
